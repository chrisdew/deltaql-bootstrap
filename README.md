Notice
------

This project is under heavy development and does not yet do anything other than pass some tests.


DeltaQL
-------

Imagine a database (like MySQL or SQLServer) whose 'result sets' automatically update as the underlying data changes.  Add to this a facility to extend these 'deltas' all the way to the browser.

Welcome to DeltaQL - no more F5, no more polling the DB.


Bootstrap
---------

This repo is a minimal webapp built using DeltaQL.  You will find the main project at https://github.com/chrisdew/deltaql#readme
